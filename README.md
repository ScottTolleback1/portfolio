# Portfolio Analytics

A hybrid project combining **Python** and **C++** for real-time stock data collection and intrinsic value analysis.

- A **Python daemon** continuously gathers price and fundamental data from Yahoo Finance and stores it in a local SQLite database.
- A **C++ Qt GUI** fetches data from the database, performs valuation and ratio analysis, and includes a fast ticker search engine.
- The system is designed for extensibility â€” new analytics tools and visualization modules are being added.

Currently working on:
- Expanding analytics functions
- Improving valuation accuracy and caching
- Adding visualization for time-series metrics
