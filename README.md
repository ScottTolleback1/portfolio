# Portfolio Analytics

A hybrid project combining **Python** and **C++** for real-time stock data collection and intrinsic value analysis.

- A **Python daemon** continuously fetches price and fundamental data from Yahoo Finance and stores it in a local **SQLite** database.
- A **C++ Qt GUI** retrieves and analyzes the data, performing valuation and ratio calculations with a fast **ticker search engine**.
- The system is built for **extensibility**, enabling future modules for analytics, visualization, and model-driven valuation.

### Currently Working On
- Expanding financial analytics and valuation methods
- Improving accuracy and caching mechanisms
- Adding visualizations for historical and time-series data
